# Whimsical Frontend Challenge

You can use this starter kit to kick things off. **This is completely
optional**; Please use whatever tools you are most comfortable with.

## Run the project

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and run the following commands:

```
npm ci
npm run watch
```

This will spin up a local web server at http://localhost:3000 using [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs).
